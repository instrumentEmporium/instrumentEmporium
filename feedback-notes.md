## General notes

- Delete stale branches, locally `git branch -d the-branch-name`
- Standardize commit message format, for example [this](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages)
- Update your README to be your own
- Get rid of `console.log`s, commented-out code, and fix inconsistent styling (spacing, indentation, naming, semicolon usage, etc)
- Like that you've started testing, keep at it!
- Consider prettier, and/or something to auto-update incorrect code style (I think eslint has a thing for this)
